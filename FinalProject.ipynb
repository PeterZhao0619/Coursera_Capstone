    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Describe the business problem \n",
    "     Currently, I am an undergraduate student. However, soon after I plan to pursue my master degree in the British. One of my dream school is LBS, and therefore I need to rent an apartment in London. There are some criteria I set for the apartment, including:\n",
    "     1. monthly rent less than 1000 pounds. \n",
    "     2. The distance to the nearest metro station is less than 1.0km\n",
    "     3. It should have at least one bedroom, one bathroom and one kitchen.\n",
    "     4. The distance to LSE would better be less than 5.0km.\n",
    "### Interested auidence\n",
    "    First, other international students who are going to study at LBS will find this report useful. It can offer them the best guide in choosing an appropriate accomendation. Second, many students who study aboard stand on benefit in reading this report, as the research methodology can be easily replicated in other cities in the North America, Asia, Austrilia and so forth."

    "  2. distance to LSE\n",
    "  \n",
    "On the other hand, we will try to find the price and descriptionof apartments from other sources like the website of Airbnb. This helps us to determine whether the apartment meets the criteria 1 and 3.\n"
